PROJECT NAME - Power Factor Calculator

PROJECT DESCRIPTION - This tool will allow a USPA, Steel Challenge or IDPA shooter to 
calculate an accurate power factor measurement for a given load by inputting their 
bullet weight and average ammo velocity.

STORY:
- As a competitive USPA, Steel Challenge, or IDPA shooter, I want to be able to calculate
an accurate power factor (PF) for my chosen handgun load so that I ensure I am shooting a legal load in competition.
